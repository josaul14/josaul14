## Join the mailing list

If you are the parent/caregiver of a minimally verbal / non-speaking person, a school, clinic, researcher or charity or anybody else with interest in my research, please [join the mailing list](https://qualtrics.ucl.ac.uk/jfe/form/SV_eKFsRuePNDwuk8C). 


## Join the research team

The lab is situated in the UCL Department of Clinical, Education and Health Psychology, in London's Bloomsbury neighbourhood, close to Euston and Russell Square stations. We are part of the broader Division of Psychology and Language Sciences (PALS), which includes a wide range of research departments such as UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, Experimental Psychology, Speech, Hearing and Phonetic Sciences (SHaPS) and Language and Cognition. Beyond PALS, UCL also has a Centre for Research in Autism and Education (CRAE) as part of IOE, UCL's Faculty of Education and Society.
